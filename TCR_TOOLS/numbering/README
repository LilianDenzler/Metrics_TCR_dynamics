Uses the new anarci package
features:
- if multiple TCRs in the pdb file, split them into seperate files, leave unpaired if chains too far away
  - this outputs a pdb with _1, _2 etc. appended to the filename
  - if there is only single tcr, skip this step
    - if only one TCR per file always consider paired
- do imgt numbering to the input file
  - output file exactly as is, but imgt numbered (if multiple tcrs, rename chains A,B, C, D etc.)
  - output file with only one imgt numbered TCR if there are multiple TCRs
  - output file with only the variable domains of one imgt numbered TCR (if multiple TCRs, do one per file)
- output CDR and FR sequences
- option to output pdb of only the cdrs/FRs
